=head1 NAME

Devel::Events::Handler::ObjectTracker - A L<Devel::Events> that tracks leaks

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use Devel::Events::Handler::ObjectTracker;
	use Devel::Events::Generator::Objects;

	my $tracker = Devel::Events::Handler::ObjectTracker->new();

	my $gen = Devel::Events::Generator::Objects->new(
		handler => $tracker,
	);

	$gen->enable(); # start generating events

	$code->();

	$gen->disable();

	use Data::Dumper;
	warn Dumper($gen->live_objects);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This object will keep track of every object created and every object destroyed
based on the C<object_bless> and C<object_destroy> events. Reblessing is
accounted for.

This handler doesn't perform any magical stuff,
L<Devel::Events::Generator::Objects> is responsible for raising the proper
events.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over 4

=item live_objects

A L<Tie::RefHash::Weak> hash that keeps an index of every live object and the
C<object_bless> event that created it.

=item class_counters

Keeps a count of the live instances per class, much like
L<Devel::Leak::Object>.

=item object_to_class

USed to maintain the C<class_counters> hash.

Adds an entry in the C<live_objects> table.

=item event_to_entry @event

Munges event data into an entry for the C<live_objects> table.

=item object_destroy
